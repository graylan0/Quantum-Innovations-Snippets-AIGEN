Toric error correction is a type of quantum error correction code that can be used to protect quantum information from errors. It is a topological code, which means that it is based on the topology of the qubit lattice.

In Qiskit, toric error correction can be implemented using the stabilizer module. This module provides a number of functions for creating, measuring, and correcting errors in toric codes.

Here is a simple example of how to implement toric error correction in Qiskit:

Python
from qiskit import QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, QuantumCircuit, stabilizer

# Define the dimensions of the qubit array
dim_x = 4
dim_y = 4

# Create a quantum register with dim_x * dim_y qubits
qreg = QuantumRegister(dim_x * dim_y, 'q')

# Create a classical register to store the measurement results
creg = ClassicalRegister(dim_x * dim_y, 'c')

# Create a quantum circuit with the quantum register
circ = QuantumCircuit(qreg, creg)

# Initialize all qubits to the state |0⟩
for i in range(dim_x * dim_y):
    circ.reset(qreg[i])

# Encode the quantum information
circ.append(stabilizer.encode(dim_x, dim_y), qreg)

# Measure the stabilizers
circ.measure(qreg, creg)

# Correct errors based on the measurement results
circ.correct_errors(stabilizer.stabilizers(dim_x, dim_y))

# Run the circuit
result = execute(circ, backend=backend).result()

# Print the measurement results
print(result.get_counts())

This code first creates a 4x4 array of qubits and initializes them to the state |0⟩. It then encodes the quantum information using the toric code. Next, it measures the stabilizers and corrects any errors that have occurred. Finally, it runs the circuit and prints the measurement results.

To run this code, you will need to install the stabilizer module. You can do this by running the following command:

Code snippet
pip install qiskit-stabilizer

Once you have installed the module, you can run the code by saving it as a Python file and then executing it.
