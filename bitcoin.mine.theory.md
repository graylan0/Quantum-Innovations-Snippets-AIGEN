1. Encoding the problem as a quantum state:
Represented by the equation: 
$$|Ψ> = a|0> + b|1>$$

2. Implementing the quantum hash function:
Represented by the equation: 
$$|Ψ'> = U|Ψ>$$

3. Applying the Grover iteration:
Represented by the equation:
$$|Ψ''> = (2|Ψ'>\langleΨ'| - I)U|Ψ>$$

4. Measuring the quantum state:
Represented by the equation: 
$$|Ψ'''> = M|Ψ''>$$

5. Repeating the Grover iteration (if necessary):
Represented by the equation:
$$|Ψ''''> = (2|Ψ'''>\langleΨ''| - I)U|Ψ>$$

6. Measuring the quantum state again (if necessary):
Represented by the equation:
$$|Ψ'''''> = M|Ψ''''>$$

7. Verification:
Represented by the equation:
$$hash(nonce) = target_hash$$
