We now begin to examine the behaviour of the $N$-point processes, which are the key ingredient in our method. To this end, we need to know more about how the $N$-point processes move at quantum computers. After defining the $N$-point processes, our E1 map turns out to be a powerful means to represent them on a finite dimensional Hilbert space. This fact will be presented later in the paper. An example of how our method generalizes to work is shown in Figure 2, which illustrates a two-dimensional two-fermion system for which we have a single eigenvalue (green) and two $N$-point processes (blue, red) are obtained by replacing $F_i$ by $\phi_i$, where $F_i=\sum_{j\in M} a_{ij}(x_i,\pi_i)e^{i \theta_j}$, with $\begin{pmatrix}a_{ij}\\g_{ij} \end{pmatrix}$ being the $n\times n$ Hermitian matrices defined in the E1 map.

It is convenient to define the matrix $M$ defined in the E1 map as $$\Psi : M \mapsto M \text{ \ \ if \ \ } \Psi^{\mathrm{E1} } \text{ \ \ is \ L},
\label{eq:M}$$ where all the eigenvalues of $\Psi$ are also given in Theorem 7 of \cite{Bacon:2017}. This will allow us to efficiently apply the E1 map. Then, $$\Psi(M) : = \sum_{\mu} a_{\mu}(x)\alpha_{\mu}(x),$$ where $\alpha_{\mu}(\cdot)$ represents the set of eigenvalues of $M$, which is defined as follows. Each eigenvalue of $\Psi$ lies on a set of ${\mathbb C}\setminus\{{0}\}$. We denote this set by $I$, where $$I= \{ j = i \mid a^0_{ij} = 0, \ n^0_{ij} = 0,\ n^1_{ij} = i,\ n^2_{ij} = i\},$$ where we use the symbol $+$ to indicate a positive or negative sign, respectively. The number of $M$-eigensors can be estimated with the help of Eq. (\[eq:E1\]), where $$E_1:=\big\{(a_i,a_j)\mid a_i = 0\,\mbox{ and }\nabla_{a_i}(x) = \pm a_{ij}(x)\big\}.
\label{eq:E1}$$

The E1 map of Eq. (\[eq:E1\]) takes the parameter vectors to be $f^{ij}(x)$ (where we distinguish between a $J$ vector and an $I$ vector) and their eigenvalues to be $|\lambda_j|=\pm 1$. We set this matrix $f^{ij}(x)$ in the following form: $$f^{ij}(x) = \lambda_j \sqrt{(x_{jj})^2 + (x_{ii}-x_{jj})^2},
\label{eq:fij}$$ where $c_{kj} = f^{ji}(x_k)$ is the eigenvalue associated with $f^{ij}(x)$. We use the notation $\lambda_j$ to indicate the $j$-th eigenvalue, where we use the symbol $\lambda_i$ to indicate a $i$-th eigenvalue. $c_{kj}$ takes on one of the following forms: $$c_{kj} = a_j\lambda_k,
\label{eq:c=1}$$ where $a_j$ takes on one of the following forms: $$\begin{aligned}
&a_j = 1, \\
&a_{jj} = -a_{jj} + \frac{\lambda_i}{\sqrt{m_i^2 + \lambda_k^2}}.\end{aligned}$$ Here the $+$ sign denotes the opposite sign, while the $-$ sign denotes the positive and negative sign of the coefficient of $x$. For the matrix $f^{ij}(x)$, we need to consider the eigenvalues $x_{ij
}$ and $x_{ji}$, as well as the parameter vectors $f^{ij}(x)$ and their eigenvalues. In quantum computing, these $N$-point processes can be analyzed using the properties of the E1 map and the eigenvalues of the defined matrices. To achieve this in a quantum computer, we must map the problem onto a quantum system and encode the parameters and the eigenvalues as qubits.

Once the problem is encoded in a quantum system, quantum algorithms can be employed to efficiently find the eigenvalues and analyze the $N$-point processes. Quantum phase estimation (QPE) is one such algorithm that can help us find the eigenvalues of a given unitary matrix, which can be used to analyze the behavior of the E1 map in the quantum realm.

The application of QPE to the E1 map and the $N$-point processes can be summarized in the following steps:

Encode the problem and the E1 map onto a quantum system by mapping the classical parameters and the matrix $M$ onto qubits.

Prepare an initial quantum state by applying the appropriate quantum gates to represent the encoded problem.

Implement the E1 map as a unitary operation on the quantum system. This can be achieved by designing a quantum circuit that approximates the E1 map.

Perform the QPE algorithm on the quantum system to estimate the eigenvalues of the E1 map.

Decode the eigenvalues and other relevant information from the quantum state, and analyze the $N$-point processes based on these values.

This approach provides a way to study the $N$-point processes in a quantum computer, leveraging the power of quantum algorithms like QPE to analyze their behavior efficiently.

We consider Alice’s Bell state to have a certain degree of quantum mechanical information (QMI). We assume the Bell state is distributed over a Gaussian distribution with a mean. The standard QMI-based protocol is also a classic quantum key distribution (QKD). There are two main problems. The first is to have no restrictions on the Gaussian distributions and the other issue is to make the QKI work in general and as well as QKI in the first place. For simplicity, we assume Gaussian distributions for the QKI protocol. We use Gaussian distributions to make the QKI work in general while for the Gaussian measurement protocol, there is no distribution. However, Gaussian measurements and QKD are considered.

To consider the QKI protocol, Alice prepares a state of a Bell state (1-photon) in three-dimensional (3-D) space:

$$\begin{array}{ll}
\text{P}_{1}(t) = \begin{bmatrix}
\text{P}_{1}(\text{P}_{0}) \\
\text{P}_{1}(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{R}^{*}) - \text{E}_{0}) \\
\text{E}_{1}(\text{P}_{0}) \\  
\text{E}_{1}(\mathbf{E}(\mathbf{R}^{*}) - \text{E}_{0}) \\
\text{E}_{1}(\partial \mathbf{t}) \\
\end{bmatrix}\\ \text{with}
\begin{bmatrix}
{} & {i_{1}} \\
{} & {i_{2}} \\
\cdots \\
{} & {i_{3}} \\
\end{bmatrix}.\\
\end{array},
\label{eq:two_quantum_qubit_state}$$

Here and in the sequel, for simplicity, $\mathbf{E}$ is always taken to be a real-valued vector that we use to represent the state of an individual quantum state of the Bell state.

Quantum Key Distribution with Gaussian Beams and Bell State Measurements

We have presented a quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol that utilizes both Gaussian beams and Bell state measurements (BSM). This protocol builds upon the well-known BB84 and E91 protocols, with the additional feature of green detector atoms to enhance security. The protocol uses a combination of physical layer encryption (PLE) and symmetric-key encryption (SK) to provide a highly secure means of key distribution.

The proposed QKD protocol begins with Alice preparing a Gaussian-distributed state of a Bell state in three-dimensional (3-D) space. This state represents a two-qubit system, which can then be sent to Bob. Alice and Bob perform Bell state measurements on their respective qubits, and the results of these measurements can be used to establish a shared secret key between them.

The use of Gaussian beams in this QKD protocol adds an additional layer of security, as the quantum states are distributed over a Gaussian distribution with a specific mean. This makes it more difficult for an eavesdropper to intercept the quantum states and obtain any useful information. Furthermore, the green detector atoms provide an additional layer of security by allowing Alice and Bob to detect any potential eavesdropping attempts.

In summary, this QKD protocol demonstrates how Gaussian beams and Bell state measurements can be combined to create a highly secure means of key distribution. By leveraging the strengths of both techniques, this protocol provides a robust and secure foundation for the transmission of sensitive information in today's increasingly connected world.
