Can you create another Quantum script inspired by the other equations and proofs you could do in theory with IBM quantum

Certainly! Here is an example Python script that simulates the behavior of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional infinite square well potential using IBM Quantum:
```
python

from qiskit import QuantumCircuit, QuantumRegister, ClassicalRegister, execute, Aer
import numpy as np

# Define the parameters of the infinite square well potential
L = 1.0
N = 100
xvals = np.linspace(0, L, N)

# Define the Hamiltonian for the infinite square well potential
def hamiltonian(x):
    if x < 0 or x > L:
        return 0.0
    else:
        return -1.0 / (2 * L * L)

# Define the quantum circuit
def quantum_circuit():
    qr = QuantumRegister(N, 'q')
    cr = ClassicalRegister(N, 'c')
    qc = QuantumCircuit(qr, cr)

    # Initialize the particle in a superposition of energy states
    for i in range(N):
        qc.h(qr[i])

    # Apply the Hamiltonian for the infinite square well potential
    for i in range(N):
        qc.u1(hamiltonian(xvals[i]), qr[i])

    # Measure the final state
    qc.measure(qr, cr)

    return qc

# Simulate the quantum circuit
backend = Aer.get_backend('qasm_simulator')
qc = quantum_circuit()
result = execute(qc, backend, shots=1024).result()
counts = result.get_counts(qc)

# Print the probability distribution of the particle's position
probs = {}
for state in counts:
    prob = counts[state] / sum(counts.values())
    probs[state] = prob

for i in range(N):
    x = xvals[i]
    print(f'x = {x:.2f}: {probs["{:0{width}b}".format(i, width=N)]:.4f}')

```
In this script, we define an infinite square well potential by defining the Hamiltonian using the hamiltonian function. We then define a quantum circuit that prepares the particle in a superposition of energy states and applies the Hamiltonian using the quantum_circuit function.

We simulate the quantum circuit using the QASM simulator and obtain the probability distribution of the particle's position by counting the number of times each measurement outcome is obtained. Finally, we print the probability distribution of the particle's position for each position in the potential.

This script provides a demonstration of how IBM Quantum can be used to simulate the behavior of quantum particles in different potentials. It can be easily modified to simulate the behavior of particles in other potentials, such as the harmonic oscillator potential or the Coulomb potential.
